## Exercises and examples from Programming Abstractions in C by Eric S. Roberts.

This is an C book written in 1998 for cs106b at Stanford University. The libararies used to run all of the examples may not run correctly in modern operating systems. One library in particular even has a comment stating that it has a memory leak. These libraries were written prior the inclusion of the Boolean type and before Valgrind existed. My goal is to update the libraries to run on modern versions of C and build unit tests and documentation into the build process.
